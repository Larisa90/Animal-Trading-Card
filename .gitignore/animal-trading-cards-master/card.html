			<p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.
				Also, they have excellent hearing and can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies.Cats can hear ultrasound,
				which is important in hunting. Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb
				 and a large surface of olfactory mucosa. Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places,
				 or perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may
				 strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a leopard.</p>
